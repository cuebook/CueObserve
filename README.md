CueObserve helps you monitor your metrics. Know when, where, and why a metric isn't right.

CueObserve uses **timeseries Anomaly detection** to find **where** and **when** a metric isn't right. It then offers **one-click Root Cause analysis** so that you know **why** a metric isn't right.

CueObserve works with data in your SQL data warehouses and databases. It currently supports Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Druid, Postgres, MySQL, SQL Server and ClickHouse.

### Getting Started

Install via Docker

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cuebook/CueObserve/latest_release/docker-compose.yml -q -O cueobserve-docker-compose.yml
docker-compose -f cueobserve-docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Now visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### How it works

You write a SQL GROUP BY query, map its columns as dimensions and measures, and save it as a virtual Dataset.

You then define one or more anomaly detection jobs on the dataset.

When an anomaly detection job runs, CueObserve does the following:

1. Executes the SQL GROUP BY query on your data warehouse and stores the result as a Pandas dataframe.
2. Generates one or more timeseries from the dataframe, as defined in your anomaly detection job.
3. Generates a forecast for each timeseries using [Prophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet).
4. Creates a visual card for each timeseries. Marks the card as an anomaly if the last data point is anomalous.

### Features

* Automated SQL to timeseries transformation.
* Run anomaly detection on the aggregate metric or split it by any dimension. Limit the split to significant dimension values.
* Use Prophet or simple mathematical rules to detect anomalies.
* In-built Scheduler. CueObserve uses Celery as the executor and celery-beat as the scheduler.
* Slack alerts when anomalies are detected.
* Monitoring. Slack alert when a job fails. CueObserve maintains detailed logs.

#### Limitations

* Currently supports Prophet for timeseries forecasting.
* Not being built for real-time anomaly detection on streaming data.
